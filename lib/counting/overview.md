# Overview of Tests Included

## Median Test

The median test compares the medians of two samples to determine if there is a statistically siginificant differenct.

This test is the nonparametric alternative to a one way ANOVA; 

### Hypothesis
- $H_o: \ \theta_0 = \theta_1 $
- The alternate hypothesis for the test is that the medians are different for both groups.

### Assumptions
- Samples should have been drawn from continuous distributions with the same shape.


**Note: This test has very low statistical power for samples drawn from normal distributions or short-tailed distributions.**
